# PRD: Karya Kilat "Executive" Revamp (Mission 2026)

## 1. Vision & Strategic Objective
To pivot Karya Kilat from a "general microsite tool" to a **High-Ticket Digital Concierge** service. We provide affluent BSD/GS business owners with "Digital Peace of Mind" through a partnership model that emphasizes status, speed, and zero technical burden.

## 2. Product Philosophy: The "Invisible" Tech
- **Relational over Transactional:** We don't sell "sites"; we provide a "Tech Partner" on speed-dial.
- **Done-For-You (DFY):** The client provides the "Soul" (via interview); Van provides the "Architecture."
- **Localized Prestige:** Every design element must feel like it belongs in a high-end Gading Serpong Ruko.

## 3. The Target Market Persona: "The Ruko Sultan"
- **Primary:** Owners of premium physical businesses in BSD/Gading Serpong.
- **Spending Power:** View IDR 5M–15M as a logical "business utility" expense, provided it saves them time and increases status.
- **Communication:** WhatsApp-centric. Prefers coffee talks over Zoom calls.

## 4. Service Tiers & Strategic Pricing
| Tier | Pricing Blueprint | Target Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Launchpad** | Rp 4.95M (Setup) | A 1-page "Authority" presence for immediate credibility. |

| **The Authority** | Rp 35M+ (Equity/Performance) | Full local dominance, SEO, and lead-gen infrastructure. |

## 5. Success Metrics
