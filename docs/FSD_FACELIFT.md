# FSD: Karya Kilat "Executive" Facelift

This document outlines the specific technical and layout modifications required to transform the current Vercel build into a High-Ticket "Digital Headquarters" showcase.

## 1. Visual Language & Branding
- **Theme:** "Dark Mode Luxury." Shift from generic blue/white to a deep charcoal/black background with gold or high-contrast white accents.
- **Typography:** Replace standard sans-serif with a high-end Serif for headings (e.g., Playfair Display or Lora) to signal "Authority."
- **Imagery:** Remove generic icons. Replace with high-resolution, localized photography of BSD/Gading Serpong business districts (e.g., The Breeze, Goldfinch).

## 2. Layout Refactoring (Section by Section)

### A. The Hero Section (The "Headquarters" Hook)
- **Current:** "Solusi Kilat - Microsite Premium & Terjangkau."
- **Update:** "Your Digital Headquarters. Professionally Managed."
- **Sub-headline:** "Stop losing premium clients to a 'Linktree' reputation. We architect bespoke digital footprints for BSD & Gading Serpong’s market leaders."
- **CTA Change:** Change "Lihat Demo" to "Request a Private Invitation." The button should trigger a clean, minimal focused WA message.

### B. The "Status Contrast" (New Section)
- **Concept:** A split-screen visual.
- **Left:** A blurry, messy "Link In Bio" (The Pain). Label: "Fragmented."
- **Right:** A clean, branded Karya Kilat Executive profile (The Power). Label: "Commanding."

### C. The "Partner" Value Prop (Replacing "Cara Kerja")
- **Shift:** Move from "3 Langkah" to "The Zero-Headache Sync."
- **Point 1:** **The 20-Minute Legacy Interview.** No forms. Just one conversation.
- **Point 2:** **WhatsApp Concierge.** Your tech partner on speed-dial.
- **Point 3:** **Global Infrastructure.** Ultra-fast loading hosted on our private cluster.

### D. Pricing Refactor
- **Current:** 3 Tiers (Basic 99k, Standard, Pro).
- **Update:** Hide all prices. Replace with:
    - **Tier: Professional Launchpad** (Available on request).
    - **Tier: Executive Command** (Bespoke Strategy).
    - **Tier: Market Authority** (Invitation Only).
- **Logic:** Prices are discussed during the "Coffee Talk" to allow for flexibility and value-based anchoring.

## 3. Technical Specs
- **Speed:** Must maintain a 90+ Score on Mobile Lighthouse.
- **WA Logic:** Every "Start" button must pre-fill the partner's name and business type into the WA message.
- **SEO:** Metadata must target local business queries (e.g., "Digital Partner Gading Serpong").
