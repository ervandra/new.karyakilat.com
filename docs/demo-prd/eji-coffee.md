## 1. Industry Research

### Specialty Coffee Market in Greater Tangerang (2026)

**Market Overview:**
- Indonesia is the 4th largest coffee producer globally; domestic specialty coffee culture has exploded since 2018
- Gading Serpong / BSD belt: high density of work-from-cafe crowd (remote workers, freelancers, SME owners)
- 2024 data: 40%+ of coffee shop revenue in Jabodetabek area comes from repeat customers
- Average spend per visit: Rp 45,000–90,000 per person
- Key differentiator: Ambiance > Price for premium local coffee shops

**Industry Trends:**
- "Third Place" culture: coffee shop as community hub, not just caffeine stop
- Specialty single-origin knowledge gap: opportunity to educate and build loyalty
- Instagram/TikTok-driven discovery: visual identity is make-or-break for walk-ins
- Local loyalty beats national chains: BSS-area customers prefer independent cafes
- WFH crowd drives afternoon revenue: power outlets, WiFi = key feature

**Competitive Landscape (Gading Serpong):**
- Starbucks / Kopi Kenangan / Janji Jiwa: Mass market, price-competitive
- Independent cafes: Strong on ambiance but weak on digital presence
- Opportunity: Professional microsite = 10x better discovery + local SEO traction

**Pain Points (Customer):**
- "Mau ngafe tapi ga tau tempatnya enak atau ga"
- "Foto di Google Maps jelek padahal tempatnya bagus"
- "Ga ada info promo atau menu terbaru"
- "Susah booking meja buat acara kecil"
