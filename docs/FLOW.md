# Customer Journey & Delivery Flow: The Partnership Path

## 1. The Approach (The Coffee Talk)
- **Step 1: The "Digital Observation":** Observe a local BSD/GS business. Notice one specific tech "pain point" (e.g., outdated links, slow load, manual WA replies).
- **Step 2: The Casual Invite:** Send a friendly, low-pressure WA message. 
  - *Script:* "Hi [Name], I'm Van, a digital architect in BSD. I saw [Shop Name] and really loved the vibe, but noticed a couple of tech friction points that might be annoying for your customers. I'm exploring a few partnerships with local shops—would love to grab a quick coffee and hear how you're growing your digital presence lately?"
- **Step 3: The Coffee Session (The Deep Listen):** Focus 80% on listening. Let them talk about their business struggles. Strategically craft your offer around the tech problems they mention.

## 2. Partnership Definition (The Shared Goal)
- **Step 4: The Legacy Session:** A 20-30 minute follow-up or voice call to extract their brand essence. 
- **Step 5: Relational Onboarding:** You handle the domain, the hosting, and the setup. They stay in their "Zone of Genius."

## 3. High-Trust Production
- **Step 6: The "Architect's Preview":** Build a draft and share it in a private link. 
- **Step 7: The Collaborative Review:** "How does this feel?" vs "Any revisions?" Use friendly, advisory language.

## 4. Handover & Ongoing Care
- **Step 8: The "Digital Headquarters" Launch:** Go live on their custom domain.
- **Step 9: The Success Packet:** Deliver a simplified briefing on how their new site drives customers to WA.
- **Step 10: The Tech Partner Retainer:** You are their "CTO-on-call." Any tweak they need, you handle it.
