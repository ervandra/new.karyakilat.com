## 1. Industry Research

### Mobile App Development Freelance Market (Indonesia 2026)

**Market Size & Demand:**
- Indonesia has 4.7M+ registered businesses (BPS 2024), majority still without a dedicated mobile app
- F&B, retail, logistics, and service sectors are the top digitalization buyers
- SME budget for apps: Rp 15M–100M (MVP to full product)
- Enterprise/funded startups: Rp 100M–500M+
- Demand spike post-COVID: mobile ordering, booking apps, delivery tracking

**Industry Pain Points (Client Side):**
- Fear of being scammed by unknown developers
- Unclear deliverables and scope creep
- Developers who disappear mid-project
- Pricing opacity — no one publishes their rates
- Technical jargon leaves non-tech clients confused

**Freelancer Competitive Landscape:**
- Most freelancers: no website, only Kalibrr/Upwork profiles
- Top performers: have portfolios on GitHub / Behance
- Very few have a dedicated personal brand microsite
- Gap: professional trust signals are almost nonexistent

**Opportunity:**
A mobile app developer with a polished, credibility-first microsite instantly stands out in a market where most competitors are anonymous faces on job boards.
